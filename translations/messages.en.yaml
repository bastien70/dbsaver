        title: How it works
        intro: This application can make automatic daily backups (and manual backups) for your MySQL databases.
        how_to: All you have to do is fill the credentials to access the databases, configure a CRON job... and it's done. Passwords will be automatically hashed.
        backups: |
            Then, using DbSaver, you can access your databases backups by browsing the <b>Backups</b> tab.
            Backups can be saved <b>locally</b> or on different cloud services using <b>S3</b> (AWS, Scaleway, ...).
